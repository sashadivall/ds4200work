            Hello! I am a third year Data Science major at Northeastern University, expected to graduate in 2026.
            Ever since I was a kid, I loved math. This led me to pursue data science in college. I had never coded
            before starting at Northeastern, but after taking the introductory courses, I fell in love with it. Data 
            science combines my two passions - math and coding - in a way that makes me feel I can make a positive
            impact on the world.
            At my first co-op, I learned a lot about AI and how it can be used in industry. I did my co-op at Bentley Systems, 
            a company that makes software for engineers, on the Applied AI team in the Civil Engineering department. I had the 
            opportunity to work on a brand new application, <a href="https://www.bentley.com/software/opensite-plus/#features">OpenSite+</a>, 
            a revolutionary, AI-driven site design software. I worked with the chatbot team, desiging a large language model to assist
            civil engineers with their project design.
